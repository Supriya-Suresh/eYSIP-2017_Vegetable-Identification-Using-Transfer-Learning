This folder contains python scripts for a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch as mentioned in the wiki.
Most of the scripts have the same function as they do in the `transfer_on_inception_v3` folder [here](https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_Vegetable-Identification-Using-Transfer-Learning/tree/master/transfer_on_inception_v3)

## convnetv1.py
